    "## Eigenfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is a bit more challenging and as such, will not count as much on the HW (points wise). For more information on this problem, see my course notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we are extremely good at distinguishing faces (most of us), different faces share much in common. We obviously have two eyes, a nose, etc.. But how can we get a compute to find a set of features that describe faces? And how can we use these to dimensionaly compress faces? One of the early techniques to do this utilized the SVD.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, I have provided code to import ~2k faces from the Yale faces database. You will need to import some packages below. This imports the data into a 2339x192x192 matrix. The first index is the number of faces and the second indices are the size of the image in pixels (192x192). Since this type of 3D matrix is not of use to us, we will need to unwrap each 2D image into a 1D image of pixels. I have provided some utility functions below to unwrap the images into vectors and to reformat them into matrices. The vectors are useful for analysis while we need them in 2D matrix form for plotting the faces themselves. All linear algebra will happen on the 2339x36864 matrix (2D) of vector faces while all plotting will happen on the 2339x192x192 matrix (3D).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is the following. We will be using the SVD to break this database of faces into features, discard less important features, and reconstruct the faces from these lower dimensional representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Just plot a face or two to get a sense of what these images look like.\n",
    "2) Compute the \"mean face\". If each face is a 2D matrix, just calculate the mean of all the 2D matrices. Plot this just to get a sense of what it looks like.\n",
    "3) Subtract that mean face from each individual face. This is mean centering. Plot a mean centered face just to get a sense of what it looks like.\n",
    "4) Take this mean centered collection of faces and transform them from a 3D to a 2D matrix as discussed above. This is what we will need for the SVD.\n",
    "5) Compute the SVD.\n",
    "6) Plot the singular values. We are trying to see how quickly they decrease in magnitude.\n",
    "7) Plot a few eigenfaces. Remember, the eigenfaces are the column vectors of V. To plot the n-th eigenface, extract the n-th column of V, reshape it into a 2D matrix, then plot that.\n",
    "8) Now lets compress the data. We are only going to keep the first 500 dimensions of the SVD. We worked with this in one of the other HW problems so I won't go into as much detail here. Remove all but the first 500 columns of U and V, and all but the first 500 singular values of D. Recompute the SVD to get a new 2339x36864 matrix (2D) of faces. Note, that before computing the SVD, we subtracted the \"mean face\" from each face. The recomputed compressed SVD thus compresses these faces in the \"mean centered\" sense. To get true faces back, we need to take each recomputed face in this recomputed SVD, and add the mean face back to it. Lets call the original matrix of faces X and the new one Xstar (after adding the mean face back).\n",
    "9) Lets look at the first face. Plot the first face contained in X and the first face contained in Xstar. You may have to reshape these back into a 2D (192x192) matrix for plotting. They should look very similar.\n"
